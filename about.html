            Georgia is a southeastern state in the United States. At its heart, it truly embraces the Southern aesthetic, but over the years, it has become a modern juggernaut, thanks in large part to Atlanta, the capital city. 
            The state is known for the peach, though its association is largely due to some stories during the Civil War. It is not the largest distributor of peaches in the world, nor does it produce the best. 
            Additionally, it played a significant role in the Civil Rights Movement, being the birthplace of Dr. Martin Luther King. Moreover, it boasts the 4th largest aquarium in the world, known as the Georgia Aquarium.
